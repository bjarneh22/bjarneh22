# Hi, I'm Bjarne 👋

I am a **B.Sc. student of Statistics and Data Science at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU)**, passionately interested in transforming complex data into actionable insights. My path led me from a background in **Sports Science and Mathematics** to the fascinating world of data analysis, where I developed a particular inclination for applying statistical methods in **professional sports**.

## 🔬 My Focus & Interests

* **Statistical Modeling & Data Analysis:** I find it fascinating how statistical methods form the basis for explaining patterns in movements and optimizing them.
* **Machine Learning:** The increasing use of artificial intelligence to improve athletes' performance particularly fascinates me.
* **Practical Applicability:** I love making complex real-world connections tangible and enabling informed decision-making.
* **Data Analysis in Professional Sports:** My career goal is to work in this field.

## 🛠️ My Skills

* **Programming Languages:**
