# Hi, I'm Bjarne 👋

I am a **B.Sc. student of Statistics and Data Science at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU)**, passionately interested in transforming complex data into actionable insights. My path led me from a background in **Sports Science and Mathematics** to the fascinating world of data analysis, where I developed a particular inclination for applying statistical methods in **sports**.

## 🔬 My Focus & Interests

* **Statistical Modeling & Data Analysis:** I find it fascinating how statistical methods form the basis for explaining patterns in movements and optimizing them.
* **Machine Learning:** The increasing use of artificial intelligence to improve athletes' performance particularly fascinates me.
* **Practical Applicability:** I love making complex real-world connections tangible and enabling informed decision-making.
* **Data Analysis in Professional Sports:** My career goal is to work in this field.

## 🛠️ My Skills

* **Programming Languages:**
    * Python (Good knowledge)
    * R (Good knowledge)
* **Software & Tools:**
    * LaTeX (Basic knowledge)
    * Microsoft Office (Word, Excel & PowerPoint - Good knowledge)
* **Methods:** Biomechanical data analysis, data processing, literature research.

## 📚 My Education

* **B.Sc. Statistics & Data Science** with minor in Computer Science | Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (since Oct 2024)
* **B.A. Mathematics & Sports Science** with focus on Teaching at Gymnasiums | Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel (Oct 2020 - Oct 2024)
* **B.A. Mathematics & Biology** with focus on Teaching at Gymnasiums | Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel (Oct 2019 - Oct 2020)
